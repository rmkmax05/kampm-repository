Volumetric Analysis Tool

This project is a simple calculator for volumetric analysis, created for use on a Casio fx-cg50-au calculator. It includes several features including unit conversion, molarity calculation, dilution calculation, and weight/volume percent calculation.
Features

    Unit Conversion: Convert between different units including ppm, ppb, ug/L, mg/L, g/L, and %w/v.
    Molarity Calculation: Calculate molarity given moles of solute and volume of solution in liters.
    Dilution Calculation: Calculate final molarity after dilution given initial molarity, initial volume, and final volume.
    Weight/Volume Percent Calculation: Calculate the weight/volume percent given mass of solute and volume of solution.

Usage

To use this tool, simply run the main.py file in your Python-enabled Casio fx-cg50-au calculator. You will be presented with a menu of options. Choose the calculation you want to perform and follow the prompts.
